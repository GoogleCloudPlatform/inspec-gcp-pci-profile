An individual knowledgeable and experienced in code-review techniques should be involved in the review process. Code reviews should be performed by someone other than the developer of the code to allow for an independent, objective review.  Automated tools or processes may also be used in lieu of manual reviews, but keep in mind that it may be difficult or even impossible for an automated tool to identify some coding issues.

Correcting coding errors before the code is deployed into a production environment or released to customers prevents the code exposing the environments to potential exploit. Faulty code is also far more difficult and expensive to address after it has been deployed or released into production environments.

Including a formal review and signoff by management prior to release helps to ensure that code is approved and has been developed in accordance with policies and procedures."
