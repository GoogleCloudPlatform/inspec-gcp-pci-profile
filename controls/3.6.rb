Considerations for defining the cryptoperiod include, but are not limited to, the strength of the underlying algorithm, size or length of the key, risk of key compromise, and the sensitivity of the data being encrypted.

Periodic changing of encryption keys when the keys have reached the end of their cryptoperiod is imperative to minimize the risk of someoneâ€™s obtaining the encryption keys, and using them to decrypt data."
